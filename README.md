github-scripts
==============

This package contains a teeny tiny interface to GitHub Enterprise's API and a couple of useful scripts.
The scripts are designed to help a course `staff` team administer individual student repositories,
all of whom belong to a `students` team.
The code itself is commented, but Scribble documentation is also provided.
